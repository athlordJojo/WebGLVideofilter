================
First, install npm by installing nodejs on your system (http://nodejs.org/).

Move via commandline into the folder of this project. 

Then run to install the npm dependencies (this installs bower)

        npm install
        
        
Now you can run 

        bower install
        
or more precisely

        ./node_modules/bower/bin/bower install
        
To install the application dependencies.

Now the application must be delivered via a webserver, like nginx.
